        <h1>Be the change you wish to see in the world.</h1>
        <p>
          I am Seevaranjinee—engineer, creator, cinephile. I live between stories, codes, and culinary arts, and believe in the endless thrill of the unfinished. Join me on a journey daring to imagine: building a sustainable, techy, and novel world, making a difference one poetic idea at a time.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                A cinephile who finds home in cinema’s frames; a planner of storms, a lover of incompleteness. My philosophy? Completeness limits us, but the uncharted allows us infinite possibility.
